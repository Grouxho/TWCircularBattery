# TWCircularBattery

This is an application to add a circular battery (via smali) to Samsung SysteUI Oreo and PIE 

## Circular Battery - Options

- Battery Size
- Stroke width
- Bold or normal text for level text
- While charging two animations are run

   . the first animation continuously rotates the battery level representation: we can change the speed of the rotation
   . the second animation is a transparency (alpha) animation that is run every time the battery level received changed (not the % but the internal bat level). We can change the duration of the animation.

- Selectable colors for battery frame, level and text, both for light and dark backgrounds.
